Assignment:

I have created this simple user journey of a Quiz Creator app.
You are required to create this interface using React and the supporting REST API.
Keep committing your code in a Git repository and publish it on GitHub with name quiz-creator.

	1. The repository should contain both the frontend and backend.
	2. Present your implementation in the README file inside the repository such as API endpoints, database design etc
